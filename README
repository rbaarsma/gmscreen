INSTALL

I've installed this pretty easily on a mac..

You'll need the following. Find their installation instructions on their websites:

npm
(home)brew 
bower

You can OPTIONALLY install these global modules for easier development:
npm install -g grunt-cli nodemon express express-generator less jshint

I've used mongodb as database:
brew install mongodb && mongod

And finally install the app normally:
npm install
bower install
